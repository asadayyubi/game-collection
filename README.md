# game-collection

This page consists of the game link (namely "Snake game" "Dice game" " drum kit" ).

=> All these three game are made using "HTML" "CSS" and "JAVASCRIPT"
=> The main goal behind making these three small projects is to practice the javascript which i've been learning from past two weeks.
=> By completing these projects, i got more better and indepth understanding of "DOM manipulation" "Events in javascript" "Using data     structure like Arrays , Object" , and also little bit of Functional programming.
=> Got basic knowledge of p5.js like canvas element and methods of canvas.
